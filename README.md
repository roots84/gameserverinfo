Started by Cory Nelson in 2004, this project came to my point of view after it was contributed [http://www.codeproject.com/KB/game/gameserverinfo.aspx to CodeProject] by Franz Pentenrieder.

Although, there are [http://www.codeproject.com/KB/game/Game_Server_Query_DLL.aspx Multithreaded library] with more complex features for CS(S), yet there are only these protocols and it is for some reason written in VB.net

For now, we support 108 different games on 8 protocols (you can see them at SupportedProtocols page)
